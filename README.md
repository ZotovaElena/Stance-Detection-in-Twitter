# Stance-Detection-in-Twitter
Machine learning models to detect stance in short documents. 

This is a part of my master thesis Stance Detection in Twitter for Spanish and Catalan. It was written during my studies in the University of the Basque Country in 2017-2019. 

Stance is a way of thinking about some topic, expressed as a public opinion. In natural language processing, stance detection stands for automatically predicting whether the author of a statement is in favor of some event or person or against it. Usually, there is the third class, neutral, which represents the texts in which neither favor nor against stance can be detected. It is considered that stance detection is a part of opinion mining and it has much in common with the sentiment analysis. In sentiment analysis, systems determine whether a given text is positive, negative, or neutral, unlike this, in stance detection, systems are to determine author’s favorability towards a given target and the target even may be implicit.
